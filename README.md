Human Activity Recognition with Deep Learning :

In this project, I developed a deep learning model to classify human activities using sensor data from smartphones. The model achieved a notable accuracy score of 95.39%.

Key Features:

Data Handling: Processed and standardized sensor data, including feature scaling and dimensionality reduction with PCA.
Model Architecture: Designed a neural network with dropout and regularization techniques to improve performance and prevent overfitting.
Evaluation: Employed various metrics including accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess model performance.
Visualization: Created plots to visualize training and validation loss and accuracy, and used heatmaps to display the confusion matrix.
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in activity recognition tasks and emphasizes the importance of careful data preprocessing and model evaluation.
